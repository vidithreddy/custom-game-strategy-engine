# Custom Game Strategy Engine (custom-game-strategy-engine)

## Purpose and Motivation
This project demonstrates modifying and extending a game engine to implement a custom winning strategy. Built on top of a provided starter framework, my work focused on rethinking the core game logic to create a new strategic experience.

I wanted to move beyond the default rules and design a winning condition that encouraged different player behaviors, changing the feel of the game while maintaining balance and challenge.

## My Contribution
- **engine.py**: Customized the win condition logic to require a score margin, making wins more strategic and less trivial.
- **board.py**: Adjusted scoring methods to include positional bonuses (e.g., central control), enabling richer evaluations that better support the new strategy.
- Emphasized realistic game design principles like rewarding central control and dynamic scoring.
- Tested and tuned logic to ensure engaging, balanced gameplay.

## Starter Code Acknowledgement
This project includes starter code (unmodified) to provide full context and runnable integration:
- **main.py**: Runs the game loop and user interface.
- **gui.py**: Provides a simple GUI for visualizing moves and board state.

These files are included as-is to show how my customized logic integrates seamlessly with the existing framework.

## Features Demonstrated
- Reading and understanding an existing codebase.
- Modifying core engine logic safely and cleanly.
- Designing custom win conditions to change strategy.
- Adjusting scoring mechanics to align with new goals.
- Clear, well-documented, recruiter-friendly code.

## Real-World Use Case
Game development frequently involves modifying existing engines and frameworks to implement new rules or balance changes. This project demonstrates professional engineering practices: understanding given code, carefully extending it, and documenting changes clearly for others to use and review.
